Privacy Policy – Nepali Radio

Last updated: August 25, 2025

Nepali Radio (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our app works and how we handle user information.

Information We Collect

Nepali Radio does not collect any personal information from users. We do not require registration, logins, or any form of user data to use the app.

The app fetches radio station lists from a public API and streams audio content. We only access internet resources necessary to play the radio.

How the App Works
	•	Users can view a list of Nepali radio stations provided via an API.
	•	Users can tap a station to start streaming audio.
	•	Audio playback continues in the background and is available on the lock screen.

Data Sharing

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is nothing shared with third parties.

Security

We do not store user data, so no personal data is at risk. All streams are delivered via standard network requests.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Updates will be reflected here.
